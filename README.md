# Sales Performance Dashboard

## 🧭 Overview
This Tableau dashboard was created as part of my data visualization practice to reinforce foundational Tableau skills. It focuses on analyzing sales, profit, and quantity metrics across product categories, regions, and time using the Superstore dataset.

While not my first dashboard, it reflects my ability to design clean, functional visualizations with interactive elements that allow users to explore business performance insights quickly and intuitively.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Tableau Public
- Superstore Dataset

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Top-Performing Categories**: Technology consistently generates the highest sales and profit margins.
- **Regional Differences**: The West region leads in overall performance, while other regions show mixed profitability.
- **Subcategory Trends**: High variance exists between product subcategories—Phones and Chairs outperform others in revenue.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Dynamic filters help users break down data by Region and Year for deeper exploration.
